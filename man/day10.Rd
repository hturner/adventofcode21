\strong{Part One}

You ask the submarine to determine the best route out of the deep-sea
cave, but it only replies:\preformatted{Syntax error in navigation subsystem on line: all of them
}

\emph{All of them?!} The damage is worse than you thought. You bring up a
copy of the navigation subsystem (your puzzle input).

The navigation subsystem syntax is made of several lines containing
\emph{chunks}. There are one or more chunks on each line, and chunks contain
zero or more other chunks. Adjacent chunks are not separated by any
delimiter; if one chunk stops, the next chunk (if any) can immediately
start. Every chunk must \emph{open} and \emph{close} with one of four legal pairs
of matching characters:
\itemize{
\item If a chunk opens with \code{(}, it must close with \verb{)}.
\item If a chunk opens with \code{[}, it must close with \verb{]}.
\item If a chunk opens with \verb{\{}, it must close with \verb{\}}.
\item If a chunk opens with \code{<}, it must close with \code{>}.
}

So, \verb{()} is a legal chunk that contains no other chunks, as is \verb{[]}.
More complex but valid chunks include \verb{([])}, \verb{\{()()()\}}, \verb{<([\{\}])>},
\verb{[<>(\{\})\{\}[([])<>]]}, and even \verb{(((((((((())))))))))}.

Some lines are \emph{incomplete}, but others are \emph{corrupted}. Find and
discard the corrupted lines first.

A corrupted line is one where a chunk \emph{closes with the wrong character}
\itemize{
\item that is, where the characters it opens and closes with do not form one
of the four legal pairs listed above.
}

Examples of corrupted chunks include \verb{(]}, \verb{\{()()()>}, \verb{(((()))\}}, and
\verb{<([])\{()\}[\{\}])}. Such a chunk can appear anywhere within a line, and
its presence causes the whole line to be considered corrupted.

For example, consider the following navigation subsystem:\preformatted{[(\{(<(())[]>[[\{[]\{<()<>>
[(()[<>])](\{[<\{<<[]>>(
\{([(<\{\}[<>[]\}>\{[]\{[(<()>
((((\{<>\}<\{<\{<>\}\{[]\{[]\{\}
[[<[([]))<([[\{\}[[()]]]
[\{[\{(\{\}]\{\}\}([\{[\{\{\{\}\}([]
\{<[[]]>\}<\{[\{[\{[]\{()[[[]
[<(<(<(<\{\}))><([]([]()
<\{([([[(<>())\{\}]>(<<\{\{
<\{([\{\{\}\}[<[[[<>\{\}]]]>[]]
}

Some of the lines aren\'t corrupted, just incomplete; you can ignore
these lines for now. The remaining five lines are corrupted:
\itemize{
\item \verb{\{([(<\{\}[<>[]\}>\{[]\{[(<()>} - Expected \verb{]}, but found \verb{\}} instead.
\item \verb{[[<[([]))<([[\{\}[[()]]]} - Expected \verb{]}, but found \verb{)} instead.
\item \verb{[\{[\{(\{\}]\{\}\}([\{[\{\{\{\}\}([]} - Expected \verb{)}, but found \verb{]} instead.
\item \verb{[<(<(<(<\{\}))><([]([]()} - Expected \code{>}, but found \verb{)} instead.
\item \verb{<\{([([[(<>())\{\}]>(<<\{\{} - Expected \verb{]}, but found \code{>} instead.
}

Stop at the first incorrect closing character on each corrupted line.

Did you know that syntax checkers actually have contests to see who can
get the high score for syntax errors in a file? It\'s true! To calculate
the syntax error score for a line, take the \emph{first illegal character} on
the line and look it up in the following table:
\itemize{
\item \verb{)}: \code{3} points.
\item \verb{]}: \code{57} points.
\item \verb{\}}: \code{1197} points.
\item \code{>}: \code{25137} points.
}

In the above example, an illegal \verb{)} was found twice (\code{2*3 = 6} points),
an illegal \verb{]} was found once (\code{57} points), an illegal \verb{\}} was found
once (\code{1197} points), and an illegal \code{>} was found once (\code{25137}
points). So, the total syntax error score for this file is
\code{6+57+1197+25137 = 26397} points!

Find the first illegal character in each corrupted line of the
navigation subsystem. \emph{What is the total syntax error score for those
errors?}
